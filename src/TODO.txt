1) Constraints (cam to cam matching)
		- Epipolar: Get fundamental matrix offline
					Points have to be on the epiline
		- Disparity: Points on the left should have a GREATER x value and not greater than a offline calculated param.
		- Orientation: Difference in horientation should be lower than 20(?) degrees.
		- Scale: One scale must be at most one level higher or lower than the other (???)
		- Unique match: If one feature is matched more than once, then it's discarded.
